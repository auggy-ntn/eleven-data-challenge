# DVC Pipeline Configuration
# Define your data processing stages here
# Each stage runs a command and tracks dependencies and outputs

# To run the pipeline: dvc repro
# To visualize: dvc dag

# stages:
#   # Stage 1: Convert raw data to intermediate format
#   bronze_to_silver:
#     cmd: uv run python3 src/data_pipelines/bronze_to_silver.py
#     deps:
#       - src/data_pipelines/bronze_to_silver.py
#       - PUT INPUT BRONZE DATA FILE PATHS HERE

#     outs:
#       - PUT OUTPUT SILVER DATA FILE PATHS HERE

#   # Stage 2: Convert silver data to gold format
#   silver_to_gold:
#     cmd: uv run python3 src/data_pipelines/silver_to_gold.py
#     deps:
#       - src/data_pipelines/silver_to_gold.py
#       - PUT INPUT SILVER DATA FILE PATHS HERE
#     outs:
#       - PUT OUTPUT GOLD DATA FILE PATHS HERE

#   # Stage 3: Train taxi time prediction models
#   train_models:
#     cmd: uv run python -m src.model_training_pipelines.train_models
#     deps:
#       - src/model_training_pipelines/train_models.py
#       - PUT INPUT GOLD DATA FILE PATHS HERE
#     outs:
#       - PUT OUTPUT MODEL FILE PATHS HERE
#       - PUT OUTPUT METRICS FILE PATHS HERE
